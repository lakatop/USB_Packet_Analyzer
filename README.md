## Introduction
App is used for analyzing and visualizing packets on USB bus. Program itself does not capture packets, but uses third-party application [USBPCAP](https://desowin.org/usbpcap/)
to obtain `.pcap` files. These files can then be interpreted after `USBPCAP` is done writing in those files. In application, this is marked as "offline" analysis. Application
also supports "live" capture when reading `.pcap` files generated by [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) by processing file while it is still beign written to.
So far application also supports semantic analysis of three basic HID devices: mouse, keyboard and joystick, and should be designed generally enough so it will be easy to add more
devices(**not** only `INTERRUPT_TRANSFER` specific).

## Technologies
* Compiled with ISO C++17 Standard
* Qt 5.15.0

## Setup
To run this project, you will need to download `Qt` version 5.15.0 or higher and then compile with `ISO C++17 Standard` or higher.
